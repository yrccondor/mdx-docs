# Before Start

Before using MDx, you should learn following information:

- MDx is compatible with most modern browsers
- MDx is free and open-sourced under GPL V3.0 license. MDx will keep free forever, but you can support me by [buying me a cup of coffee](help-us.md)
- MDx is still developing, please stay tuned for new features
- MDx was fully tested under WordPress 5.0+, please [contact me](https://github.com/yrccondor/mdx/issues/new) if you find any problem

To install MDx, you need to download it first. You can download MDx from the [theme website](https://mdx.flyhigher.top) or [Github Releases](https://github.com/yrccondor/mdx/releases).
