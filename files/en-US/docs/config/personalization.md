# Personalization

When MDx is activated, "MDx theme" will appear on the admin penal sidebar. Click to enter the MDx settings.


Normally, "MDx theme" will be displayed at the end of the sidebar. If you cannot find that, please check your user permissions. Any user with `manage_options` permission should get the entry.
